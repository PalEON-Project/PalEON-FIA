#### NOTE:5-26-17 JP decided to use Jenkins since the biomass manuscript is comparing FIA biomass to PLS biomass and the PLS biomass was estimated with the Jenkin's allometries. ###
# for now if you use Pecan, just use point estimate, namely biomass_pecan_pred_mean
# CJP believes that 'pred' are the columns to use as these should incorporate tree-to-tree variability
