## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Select most recent survey
Query SQL for FIA Survey data, and select the cycle and subcycle closest to the specified year 
```{r Survey_data}
library(knitr)
source('~/PalEON-FIA/Query_Survey.R')
```

## Select FIA data from SQL
Select FIA Tree and Plot data, and return a csv with this data
```{r Tree_data}
source('~/PalEON-FIA/SQL_Query4.R')
```

## Estimate Jenkins Biomass
Use the method from Jenkins et al. 2004 to estimate tree level biomass from the FIA tree data
```{r Jenkins_biomass}
source('~/PalEON-FIA/Jenkins_biom.R')
```

## Estimate FIA Biomass
Use the FIA biomass estimates to get tree level biomass
```{r FIA_biomass}
source('~/PalEON-FIA/FIA_biom.R')
```

## Estimate PEcAn Biomass
Use the PEcAn allometry package to calculate tree level biomass from the FIA tree data
```{r PEcAn_biomass}
source('~/PalEON-FIA/PEcAn_biom.R')
```

## Aggregate Biomass
Aggregate Jenkins, FIA, and PEcAn biomass estimtates to the plot level. Returns csv of all three biomass estimates at the plot level, by species
```{r Aggregate_biomass}
source('~/PalEON-FIA/Plot_biom_agg.R')
```
